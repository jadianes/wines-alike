WinesAlike is a PHP (together with Java for admin tasks) framework for deploying wine affinity websites.

== Model-View-Controller Architecture ==
It follows a "Model-View-Controller" architectural style where data models (together with business rules) are separated from information presentation (views) and user interaction (controllers).

- Models: WinesAlike models are represented by PHP5 OO classes in folder /models. They encapsulate many MySQL tables and also implement business rules (e.g. suggestion algorithm) as well as user management, session management, and configuration files (i.e. config.php file).

- Views: WinesAlike views are generated using the Smarty PHP template engine, and are styled using html5+CSS5 thanks to Boostrap from Twitter. Additional CSS classes and rules are defined in folder /css.

- Controllers: WinesAlike controllers work pretty much like Zend controllers. They are contained in folder /controllers where a front controller parses clean URLs (after passing Apache mod_rewrite rules) and call the appropriate action controller. URLs follow the patter:

http://domain-name/controller/action/key1/value1/key2/value2...

where controller has to be implemented by a class with the same name inside the folder /controllers, and action is a method of this class. Keys and values will be passed as arguments to this method.

== Test cases ==
Test cases are based in PHPUnit, and can be found in folder /tests

== API ==
The folder /API contains controllers (following a similar schema to html controllers) that return JSON objects for different actions. It can be used as REST services (e.g. in mobile clients).

== MANAGER TOOL ==
The framework includes a Manager tool implemented in Java and using JDBC to access the MySQL tables used by WinesAlike.

The tool allows generating XML reports from database queries using JAXB.

It also provides an HTTP interface through Servlets that allows generating/deleting new reports remotely (POAT NS DELETE) an also retrieve them (GET).

== INSTALLATION ==
The script install.php creates all the MySQL tables containing the model data. This script uses the configuration parameters defined in 'models/config.php'.

Wines-alike uses Smarty template engine to render html views. Therefore Smarty has to be installed. The installer also uses Smarty. It can be found in http://www.smarty.net.
