WinesAlike is a PHP script for deploying wine affinity websites.

It follows a "Model-View-Controller" architectural style where data models (together with business rules) are separated from information presentation (views) and user interaction (controllers).

Our models are representd by PHP classes in the folder models.

Data from this models are queried by PHP scripts and rendered using Smarty templates contained in the folder templates. There are also scripts rendering data as JSON objects.

Templates contain also forms and buttons that call PHP scripts that process this input and invoke the proper scripts.

INSTALLATION

The script install.php creates all the MySQL tables containing the model data.

Wines-alike uses Smarty template engine to render html views. Therefore Smarty has to be installed. The installer also uses Smarty. It can be found in http://www.smarty.net.
